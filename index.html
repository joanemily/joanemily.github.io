        <p> <text>As an artist, my mission was to add depth to everyday connections and encounters. As a programmer, it
                remains unchanged. Whether in photography or EMS, I regularly took notice of details that are often
                overlooked by others - a skill that I carried with me into my work in administration. At C.C. Supply, I
                noticed that the system for scheduling and tracking deliveries was unreliable and chaotic. I updated it
                to streamline the information and make sure that it was available to the drivers even when I wouldn't be
                there. At Western Reserve Hospital Gastroenterology, I helped implement a process that assisted
                Pharmaceutical representatives when ordering lunches and saved them over hundreds of dollars while
                preventing food waste.</text>
            <br>
            <br>
            <text>I have always prided myself on being clever and resourceful in working with and around systems to help
                companies save money, capture efficiencies, and eliminate confusion. Currently, I am studying .NET at
                Tech Elevator and I'm energized by the vast amount of new opportunities in the tech field that will
                allow me to reinforce my personal mission of serving others while challenging myself.</text></p>

                    <p> During our first capstone, created a console app in a pairs exercise that built a virtual
                        vending
                        machine. Developed in C# using OOP fundamentals using File I/O. </p>

                    <h3>National Parks Reservation App</h3>
                    <p> Our second capstone was creating a National Parks reservation console application. This was a
                        pairs
                        exercise in which we practiced new skills in Microsoft SQL Server; ran integration tests. </p>

                    <h3>National Parks Web App</h3>
                    <p> For our third capstone, we built on the National Parks application. Also a pairs exercise, we
                        had
                        the opportunity to utilize what we studied about MVC and design. We developed and designed a
                        dynamic
                        web application with ASP.NET that implemented MVC framework using C#, SQL Server integration,
                        HTML
                        and CSS.</p>
